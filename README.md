# SH-modeling
Code to make calculations within the model developed in my B.Sc. thesis.

Consists of three files: 

1. SH_model_final.R - R code where the actual calculations and plotting of results take place.
2. distributions_final.R - file where all distributions necessary for calculations are defined. 
3. plot_distributions_final.R - short script to create some graphs for illustration purposes.
